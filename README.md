sudo wget -qO /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/papirus-ppa.asc 'https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x9461999446FAF0DF770BFC9AE58A9D36647CAE7F'

## Hardcoded icons

Some software uses an absolute path instead of an icon name in a .desktop file or in the source code which makes them unthemable.

### Hardcoded application icons

To deal with hardcoded application icons we recommend using [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer). Papirus supports most of the applications in the [list](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/blob/master/tofix.csv). If hardcode-fixer doesn't support your favorite app yet, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/issues) or edit your .desktop file manually.

### Hardcoded tray icons

To fix hardcoded tray icons Papirus supports [Hardcode-Tray](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray) script. A list of supported applications is available [here](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray/tree/master/data/database).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To get Papirus to work right with Hardcode-Tray, use the hardcode-tray option `--conversion-tool RSVGConvert`:

```
sudo -E hardcode-tray --conversion-tool RSVGConvert --size 22 --theme Papirus
```

**Size recommendations:**

- Unity: 22px
- KDE: 24px
- GNOME: 22px ([see](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme#manual-fixes) for more info)
- XFCE: 22px ([see](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme#manual-fixes) for more info)
- Pantheon: 24px
- Cinnamon: 16px
- LXQt: 16px


![hardcode-tray](https://i.imgur.com/6hFm6aj.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Some Electron-based applications have blurred tray icon on KDE (see [bug report](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=366062)). To solve this issue pass the following environment variable to the app: `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=Unity wire-desktop`

### Steam runtime icons

To fix icons of running Steam games, you can use the [Steam Icons Fixer](https://github.com/BlueManCZ/SIF) script, that will apply all available icons from our icon theme to your installed games.

## KDE colorscheme

> [!NOTE]
> This is probably depreciated with Plasma 6. Choose Papirus variant according to your color scheme because some symbolic icons are not recolorable.

Support for monochrome icons for KDE colorscheme is now available:
- Papirus - for dark Plasma theme (light panel icons) & light color scheme (dark action icons)
- Papirus Dark - for dark plasma theme & color scheme (all icons are light)
- Papirus Light - for light plasma theme & color scheme (all icons are dark)

![kde-color-scheme](https://i.imgur.com/oM1qhQH.png)

## Folder color

Papirus has [Folder Color](https://github.com/costales/folder-color/) v0.0.80+ support that allows you to change a color of a folder.

Available colors:

![Folder Color Preview](https://i.imgur.com/8mUAbIA.png)

For KDE, colors of individual folders can be changed using [dolphin-folder-color](https://github.com/audoban/dolphin-folder-color).

Also, you can use our [papirus-folders](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-folders) script to change the color of folders system-wide.

## Extras

- [Papirus themes for FileZilla](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-filezilla-themes)
- [Papirus theme for SMPlayer](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-smplayer-theme)
- [Papirus themes for Claws Mail](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-claws-mail-theme)
- [Papirus themes for Thunderbird](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/thunderbird-theme-papirus)
- [Papirus theme for aMule](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-amule-theme)

## Recommendations

- Papirus users are expected to have Breeze installed if they use Plasma and/or any KDE applications
- The same applies to ePapirus and the Elementary icon theme when using the Pantheon desktop, as the icon parity between the themes are not full

- We recommend the following GTK themes to use with Papirus icons:
  - [Arc theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme)
  - [Materia theme](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme)
- For KDE Plasma 5, our recommendations are:
  - [Arc KDE](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde)
  - [Materia KDE](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/materia-kde)

## Manual fixes

<details>
<summary>For Pop!_OS users</summary>

For Pop!_OS users who want to use the [Pop!_Shop](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/blob/master/Papirus/64x64/apps/pop-shop.svg) icon (instead of the default [Elementary Appcentre](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/blob/master/Papirus/64x64/apps/io.elementary.appcenter.svg) icon):

```
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/applications/
cp /usr/share/applications/io.elementary.appcenter.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
desktop-file-edit --set-icon=pop-shop ~/.local/share/applications/io.elementary.appcenter.desktop
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>For Cinnamon users</summary>

For Cinnamon users who want to use Papirus icon theme with [Arc theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) we recommend fixing the color icons on panel:

```
sudo sed -i.orig 's/white/#d3dae3/g' /usr/share/themes/Arc-Dark/cinnamon/cinnamon.css
```

![Cinnamon Arc-Dark theme fix](https://i.imgur.com/XXejgtD.png)

To deal with blurry panel icons, increase the panel size to 30px in `Systems Settings` ‚Üí `Panel` (see the [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/oToRBYv.png)).
</details>

<details>
<summary>For GNOME Shell users</summary>

<summary>For elementary/Pantheon users</summary>

With light wallpaper, we recommend disabling the `use-transparency` option on wingpanel:

For better representation we recommend using only the light eGTK Theme:

```
echo "export GTK_THEME=elementary" >> ~/.profile
```
Restart the system to apply new changes .
